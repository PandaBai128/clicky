## Overview

macOS menu bar companion app. Lives entirely in the macOS status bar (no dock icon, no main window). Clicking the menu bar icon opens a custom floating panel with companion voice controls. Uses push-to-talk (ctrl+option) to capture voice input, transcribes it via Tencent Cloud ASR streaming, and sends the transcript + a screenshot of the user's screen to MiniMax. MiniMax responds with text (streamed via SSE) and voice (MiniMax TTS). A blue cursor overlay can fly to and point at UI elements the model references on any connected monitor.

All API keys live on a Cloudflare Worker proxy — nothing sensitive ships in the app.

## Architecture

- **App Type**: Menu bar-only (`LSUIElement=true`), no dock icon or main window
- **Framework**: SwiftUI (macOS native) with AppKit bridging for menu bar panel and cursor overlay
- **Pattern**: MVVM with `@StateObject` / `@Published` state management
- **AI Chat**: MiniMax-M3 via Cloudflare Worker proxy with Anthropic-compatible SSE streaming
- **Speech-to-Text**: Tencent Cloud ASR real-time streaming via signed websocket URL, with AssemblyAI, OpenAI, and Apple Speech still available as fallback implementations
- **Text-to-Speech**: MiniMax T2A via Cloudflare Worker proxy. LLM text is segmented at sentence boundaries as it streams; MiniMax audio frames are parsed incrementally and played through a cancellable Audio Queue before each MP3 finishes downloading.
- **Screen Capture**: ScreenCaptureKit (macOS 14.2+), multi-monitor support
- **Voice Input**: Push-to-talk via `AVAudioEngine` + pluggable transcription-provider layer. System-wide keyboard shortcut via listen-only CGEvent tap.
- **Element Pointing**: The vision model embeds normalized `[POINT_V2:x,y:label:screenN]` tags using a fixed 0–1000 coordinate space. The overlay parses these, maps coordinates to the correct monitor, and animates the blue cursor along a bezier arc to the target. Legacy `[POINT:...]` tags are stripped but never move the cursor.
- **Concurrency**: `@MainActor` isolation, async/await throughout
- **Analytics**: PostHog via `ClickyAnalytics.swift`

### API Proxy (Cloudflare Worker)

The app never calls external APIs directly. All requests go through a Cloudflare Worker (`worker/src/index.ts`) that holds the real API keys as secrets.

| Route | Upstream | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `POST /chat` | `api.minimax.io/anthropic/v1/messages` | MiniMax-M3 vision + streaming chat |
| `POST /tts` | `api.minimax.io/v1/t2a_v2` | MiniMax TTS audio |
| `POST /tts-stream` | `api.minimax.io/v1/t2a_v2` | MiniMax streaming TTS converted from SSE hex frames to chunked MP3 |
| `POST /voices` | `api.minimax.io/v1/get_voice` | List system and account-specific MiniMax voices |
| `POST /transcribe-url` | Signed `asr.cloud.tencent.com` websocket URL | Fetches a short-lived Tencent Cloud ASR websocket URL |

Worker secrets: `MINIMAX_API_KEY`, `TENCENT_ASR_APP_ID`, `TENCENT_ASR_SECRET_ID`, `TENCENT_ASR_SECRET_KEY`
Worker vars: `MINIMAX_TTS_MODEL`, `MINIMAX_TTS_VOICE_ID`, `MINIMAX_TTS_VOLUME`, `TENCENT_ASR_ENGINE_MODEL_TYPE`

### Key Architecture Decisions

**Menu Bar Panel Pattern**: The companion panel uses `NSStatusItem` for the menu bar icon and a custom borderless `NSPanel` for the floating control panel. This gives full control over appearance (dark, rounded corners, custom shadow) and avoids the standard macOS menu/popover chrome. The panel is non-activating so it doesn't steal focus. A global event monitor auto-dismisses it on outside clicks.

**Cursor Overlay**: A full-screen transparent `NSPanel` hosts the blue cursor companion. It's non-activating, joins all Spaces, and never steals focus. The cursor position, response text, waveform, and pointing animations all render in this overlay via SwiftUI through `NSHostingView`.

**Global Push-To-Talk Shortcut**: Background push-to-talk uses a listen-only `CGEvent` tap instead of an AppKit global monitor so modifier-based shortcuts like `ctrl + option` are detected more reliably while the app is running in the background.

**Shared URLSession for Streaming ASR**: A single long-lived `URLSession` is shared across streaming ASR sessions (owned by the provider, not the session). Creating and invalidating a URLSession per session can corrupt the OS connection pool and cause "Socket is not connected" errors after a few rapid reconnections.

**Transient Cursor Mode**: When "Show Clicky" is off, pressing the hotkey fades in the cursor overlay for the duration of the interaction (recording → response → TTS → optional pointing), then fades it out automatically after 1 second of inactivity.

## Key Files

| File | Lines | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `leanring_buddyApp.swift` | ~89 | Menu bar app entry point. Uses `@NSApplicationDelegateAdaptor` with `CompanionAppDelegate` which creates `MenuBarPanelManager` and starts `CompanionManager`. No main window — the app lives entirely in the status bar. |
| `CompanionManager.swift` | ~1040 | Central state machine. Owns dictation, shortcut monitoring, screen capture, vision API, streaming TTS, and overlay management. Tracks voice state (idle/listening/processing/responding), conversation history, model selection, persisted response-length and TTS settings, and cursor visibility. Coordinates the full push-to-talk → screenshot → MiniMax → TTS → optional pointing pipeline. |
| `PointingRequestPolicy.swift` | ~105 | Transcript-only policies that request cursor guidance for visible targets and high-resolution screenshots for on-screen text extraction while excluding non-visual topics. |

## Build & Run

```bash
# Open in Xcode
open leanring-buddy.xcodeproj

# Select the leanring-buddy scheme, set signing team, Cmd+R to build and run

# Known non-blocking warnings: Swift 6 concurrency warnings,
# deprecated onChange warning in OverlayWindow.swift. Do NOT attempt to fix these.
```

**Do NOT run `xcodebuild` from the terminal** — it invalidates TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) permissions and the app will need to re-request screen recording, accessibility, etc.

## Code Style & Conventions

### Variable and Method Naming

IMPORTANT: Follow these naming rules strictly. Clarity is the top priority.

- Be as clear and specific with variable and method names as possible
- **Optimize for clarity over concision.** A developer with zero context on the codebase should immediately understand what a variable or method does just from reading its name
- Use longer names when it improves clarity. Do NOT use single-character variable names
- Example: use `originalQuestionLastAnsweredDate` instead of `originalAnswered`
- When passing props or arguments to functions, keep the same names as the original variable. Do not shorten or abbreviate parameter names. If you have `currentCardData`, pass it as `currentCardData`, not `card` or `cardData`

### Code Clarity

- **Clear is better than clever.** Do not write functionality in fewer lines if it makes the code harder to understand
- Write more lines of code if additional lines improve readability and comprehension
- Make things so clear that someone with zero context would completely understand the variable names, method names, what things do, and why they exist
- When a variable or method name alone cannot fully explain something, add a comment explaining what is happening and why

### Swift/SwiftUI Conventions

- Use SwiftUI for all UI unless a feature is only supported in AppKit (e.g., `NSPanel` for floating windows)
- All UI state updates must be on `@MainActor`
- Use async/await for all asynchronous operations
- Comments should explain "why" not just "what", especially for non-obvious AppKit bridging
- AppKit `NSPanel`/`NSWindow` bridged into SwiftUI via `NSHostingView`
- All buttons must show a pointer cursor on hover
- For any interactive element, explicitly think through its hover behavior (cursor, visual feedback, and whether hover should communicate clickability)

### Do NOT

- Do not add features, refactor code, or make "improvements" beyond what was asked
- Do not add docstrings, comments, or type annotations to code you did not change
- Do not try to fix the known non-blocking warnings (Swift 6 concurrency, deprecated onChange)
- Do not rename the project directory or scheme (the "leanring" typo is intentional/legacy)
- Do not run `xcodebuild` from the terminal — it invalidates TCC permissions

## Git Workflow

- Branch naming: `feature/description` or `fix/description`
- Commit messages: imperative mood, concise, explain the "why" not the "what"
- Do not force-push to main
